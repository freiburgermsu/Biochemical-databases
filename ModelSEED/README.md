# Thermodynamic contributions of biochemical reactions
The thermodynamically described reactions of the NIST and Karr et al. databases were organized through the codes of the "2021-03-25_APF_contrasting the Karr et al. and NIST databases_01.ipynb" Notebook. The intermediary files of thermodynamically described reactions and compounds from each dataset are provided in the respective folders. The complete sets of described reactions and consitutent compounds are described by the "2021-04-30_APF_complete thermodynamically described reactions for KEGG_01" and "2021-04-29_APF_complete thermodynamically described compounds for KEGG_01" JSON files, respectively.

The KEGG IDs for each compounds will be scraped to definitively identity each reaction. The final set of reactions and compounds, with the respective KEGG IDs, will be exported as TSV files that and passed through the ModelSEED repository codes to contribute our data to the ModelSEED database.
