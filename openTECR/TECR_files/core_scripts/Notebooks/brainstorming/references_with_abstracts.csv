Mandarin) which form lignin during growth. These enzymes could be separated from each other by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100, and hydroxyapatite. The molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a Sephadex G-100 column and were found to be about 43,000 (isoenzyme 1) and 69,000 (isoenzyme 2). Maximum rates of reaction were observed in the case of coniferyl alcohol oxidation at pH 9.2 (Isoenzyme 1) and pH 8.8 (isoenzyme 2); in the reverse reaction pH 6.5 was optimal for isoenzyme 2. Whereas isoenzyme 1 is specific for coniferyl alcohol, isoenzyme 2 can also oxidize cinnamyl alcohol and a number of substituted cinnamyl alcohols, Km values for substituted cinnamaldehydes are 3-11 times lower than for the corresponding alcohols. Neither isoenzyme reacted with benzyl alcohol, anisic alcohol or ethanol. Substrate inhibition for the forward and reverse reaction was found with isoenzyme 2 but not with isoenzyme 1. The equilibrium constant was determined to be about 10(9) in favour of coniferaldehyde reduction. The possible role of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis is discussed.",75WYR/GRI,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1975.tb02418.x,75WYR/GRI_223

It is independent of cyclic AMP when the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase is used.

The rate equation of enzyme reaction for two substrates was used for determination of the equilibrium constant and Michaelis constants of the enzyme.

Stopped-flow experiments showed initial very fast extinction changes at 605 nm and at 563 nm, indicating the simultaneous reduction of cytochrome a and oxidation of ferrocytochrome c. During this 'burst' phase, say the first 50 ms after mixing, it was invariably found that more cytochrome c had been oxidized than cytochrome a had been reduced. This discrepancy in electron equivalents may be accounted for by the rapid reduction of another redox site in the enzyme, possibly that associated with the extinction changes observed at 830 nm. During the incubation period in which the partially reduced oxidase was prepared, the rate of reduction of cytochrome a by ferrocytochrome c, at constant reactant concentrations, decreased with time. Temperature-jump experiments showed the presence of two relaxation processes. The faster of the two phases was assigned to the electron-transfer reaction between cytochrome c and cytochrome a. A study of the concentration-dependence of the reciprocal relaxation time for this phase yielded a rate constant of 9 X 10(6)M-1-s-1 for the electron transfer from cytochrome c to cytochrome a, and a value of 8.5 X 10(6)M-1-s-1 for the reverse reaction. The equilibrium constant for the electron-transfer reaction is therefore close to unity. The slower phase has been interpreted as signalling the transfer of electrons between cytochrome a and another redox site within the oxidase molecule.",76GRE/BRI,10.1042/bj1570591,76GRE/BRI_328

Three of the four substrates, ATP, ADP, and P-arginine produce easily distinguishable resonances in the 31P NMR spectrum, thus permitting a determination of equilibrium constants from the integrated areas of the resonances. From the linewidths, the exchange rates between reactants and products may be evaluated. At pH 7.25 and a temperature of 12 degrees, the equilibrium constant at catalytic enzyme concentration: Keq = [MgADP] [P-arginine]/[MgATP] [L-arginine], is found to be 0.10 +/- 0.02 and that at stoichiometric enzyme concentration: K'eq = [E-MgADP] [E-P-arginine]/[E-MgATP] [E-arginine] to be 1.56 +/- 0.5. Thus, as the enzyme concentration increased, the production of P-arginine is increasingly favored. From the NMR line shapes in the presence of excess enzyme, the rate of the single step, the transfer of the phosphoryl group on the surface of the enzyme is found to be 192 +/- 15 s-1 in the forward direction, i.e. from E-MgATP, and 154 +/- 15 s-1 in the reverse direction from E-P-argine. At 12 degrees and pH 7.25, the rate of the overall reaction in the forward direction was determined from kinetic measurements to be 19 s-1, an order of magnitude slower than the rate measured by NMR. It can, therefore, be concluded that the interconversion of substrates on the surface of the enzyme is not the rate-determining step in the overal reaction.

A variety of phosphonates have been shown to substitute for phosphate in this reaction [Gardner, J. H., & Byers, L. D., (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5925--5927]. The dependence of the logarithm of the equilibrium constant for the reaction on the pKa2 value of the phosphonate is characterized by a Brłnsted coefficient, betaeq, of approximately 1. This represents the sensitivity of the transfer of the phosphoglyceroyl group between the active-site sulfhydryl residue (in the acyl-enzyme intermediate) and the acyl acceptor on the basicity of the acyl acceptor. Molybdate (MoO42-) can also serve as an acyl acceptor in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction. The second-order rate constant for the reaction with molybdate is only approximately 12 times lower than the reaction with phosphate even though the pKa2 of molybdate is 3.1 units lower than the pKa2 of phosphate. The immediate product of the molybdate reaction is the acyl molybdate, 1-molybdo-3-phosphoglycerate. The acyl molybdate, like the acyl arsenate (the immediate product of the reaction when arsenate is the acyl acceptor), is kinetically unstable. At pH 7.3 (25 degrees C), the half-life for hydrolysis of the acyl molybdate, or the acyl arsenate, is less than 2.5 s. Thus, hydrolysis of 1-molybdo- and 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is at least 2000 times faster than hydrolysis of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate under the same conditions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has a fairly broad specificity for acyl acceptors. Most tetrahedral oxy anions tested are substrates for the enzyme (except SO4(2-) and SeO4(2-)). Tetrahedral monoanions such as ReO4- and GeO(OH)3- are not substrates but do bind to the enzyme. These results suggest the requirement of at least one anionic site on the acyl acceptor required for binding and another anionic group on the acyl receptor required for nucleophilic attack on the acyl enzyme.",79BYE/SHE,10.1021/bi00579a006,79BYE/SHE_255

Comparison of Ki values for competitive inhibitors suggested that binding of the l-carboxyl of L-malate is by ion pairing with lysine or arginine, while binding of the 4-carboxyl is weaker, and probably of the induced-dipolar type. The 2-hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to a catalytic group, which, when it is protonated, adsorbs the keto form of oxalacetate. Since the only molecule other than L-malate that is oxidized is L-malate-beta-amide, carbon 4 must be trigonal for substrate activity, although a tetrahedral carbon bearing one or two hydroxyl groups gives good binding. Hydroxy groups at carbon 3 contribute to binding, but prevent substrate activity. Hydroxy and ketomalonates are bound more strongly than any of the four carbon acids, suggesting that the latter are bound with some strain. In inhibition studies, pyruvate analogues were competitive vs. pyruvate but noncompetitive vs. malate, while malate analogues were competitive vs. malate and noncompetitive vs. pyruvate. These compounds thus bind to both enzyme-triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPN) and enzyme-reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPNH), but only malate analogues prevent release of TPN, while pyruvate analogues prevent release of TPNH. Ketomalonate and oxalacetate, both of which are slowly reduced by the enzyme in the presence of TPNH and thus must combine in the keto form with E-TPNH,, appear to combine with E-TPN mainly in the gem-diol (or for oxalacetate, also the enol) form.

The equilibrium constant and the progress curves were measured by use of the difference in absorbance between indole and indoleglycerol phosphate. Stopped-flow measurements show that only the non-hydrated form of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate serves as substrate. The product analogue indolepropanol phosphate was used as an inhibitor to discriminate between possible mechanisms. The data agree well with an ordered addition mechanism with D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate adding first. Mechanisms involving random addition of substrates or ordered addition with indole adding first can be excluded because indolepropanol phosphate is a competitive inhibitor only towards glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The high affinity of tryptophan synthase for indoleglycerol phosphate leads to product inhibition even at small extents of reaction. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate combines with the enzyme with an apparent second-order rate constant, which is not diffusion controlled and generates a site with high affinity for indole.",76WEI/KIR,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1976.tb10350.x,76WEI/KIR_1179

With malate-2-d, isotope effects for malic enzyme at pH 7.1 and malate dehydrogenase at pH 9.3 of 1.45 and 1.70-2.16 (depending on oxaloacetate level) were determined with this method, while the corresponding isotope effects on V/Kmalate and V for the chemical reactions were 1.5-1.8 and 1.0, and 1.9 and 1.5 for the two enzymes. The advantage of this method is its extreme sensitivity, and the lack of interference from various artifacts.

The ratio of ebgA-gene product of ebgC-gene product in the functional aggregate of ebg beta-galactosidases was determined to be 1:1 by isolation of the enzyme from bacteria grown on uniformly radiolabelled amino acids and separation of the subunits by gel-permeation chromatography under denaturing conditions. 2. This datum, taken together with a recalculation of the previous ultracentrifuge data [Hall (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 107, 71-84], analytical gel-permeation chromatography and electron microscopy, strongly suggests an alpha 4 beta 4 quaternary structure for the enzyme. 3. The second chemical step in the enzyme turnover sequence, hydrolysis of the galactosyl-enzyme intermediate, is markedly slower for ebgab, having both Asp-97----Asn and Trp-977----Cys changes in the large subunit, than for ebga (having only the first change) and ebgb (having only the second), and is so slow as to be rate-determining even for an S-glycoside, beta-D-galactopyranosyl thiopicrate, as is shown by nucleophilic competition with methanol. 4. The selectivity of galactosyl-ebgab between water and methanol on a molar basis is 57, similar to the value for galactosyl-ebgb. 5. The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of lactose at 37 degrees C is 152 +/- 19 M, that for hydrolysis of allolactose is approx. 44 M and that for hydrolysis of lactulose is approx. 40 M. 6. A comparison of the free-energy profiles for the hydrolyses of lactose catalysed by the double mutant with those for the wild-type and the single mutants reveals that free-energy changes from the two mutations are not in general independently additive, but that the changes generally are in the direction predicted by the theory of Burbaum, Raines, Albery & Knowles [(1989) Biochemistry 28, 9283-9305] for an enzyme catalysing a thermodynamically irreversible reaction. 7. Michaelis-Menten parameters for the hydrolysis of six beta-D-galactopyranosylpyridinium ions and ten aryl beta-galactosides by ebgab were measured. 8. The derived beta 1g values are the same as those for ebgb (which has only the Trp-977----Cys change) and significantly different from those for ebgo (the wild-type enzyme) and ebga. 9.

The corresponding standard apparent entropy of the reaction (delta S' degree) was +4.70 J K-1 mol-1. The linear function (r2 = 0.99) between log10 K' and 1/K demonstrates that both delta H' degree and delta S' degree are independent of temperature for the creatine kinase reaction, and that delta Cp' degree, the standard apparent heat capacity of products minus reactants in their standard states, is negligible between 5 and 38 degrees C. We further show from our data that the sign and magnitude of the standard apparent Gibbs energy (delta G' degree) of the creatine kinase reaction was comprised mostly of the enthalpy of the reaction, with 11% coming from the entropy T delta S' degree term.

At ethanol concentrations greater than 35 mM, the activity was found to decrease montonically. In contrast, ethanol (35-400 mM) increased the activity of soluble AChE. This biphasic behavior was consistent with the proposed important role of ethanol-membrane interaction.

This discrepancy was attributed to the presence of membranes.

When ethyl glycerate is tosylated and treated similarly with thiophosphate, a 5:1 mixture of 3-thioglycerate-3-P and the 2-isomer is formed. 6-Thioglucose-6-P is converted by glycolytic enzymes to triose phosphates, 3-thioglycerol-3-P and 3-thioglycerate-3-P, and is oxidized by enzymes of the hexose monophosphate shunt to 5-thioribulose-5-P, which can be converted via phosphoribulokinase and ribulose-bis-P carboxylase into 3-P-glycerate and 3-thioglycerate-3-P. For most of the non-phosphoryl-transferring enzymes there are only moderate effects on Vmax and Km. Phosphoglucoisomerase, however, is very sensitive to the sulfur for oxygen change, with Vmax decreasing 60-fold and Km increasing 15-fold.

Experiments performed in buffer systems of varying ionization enthalpies allow determination of the net number of protons absorbed or released during the course of the reaction. For cytochrome c oxidase the intrinsic enthalpy of reaction was determined to be -16.5 kcal/mol with one (0.96) proton consumed for each ferrocytochrome c molecule oxidized.

The ionic strength dependence was similar for both detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase. Despite the large ionic strength dependence of the kinetic parameters, the enthalpy measured for the reaction was found to be independent of ionic strength. Additional experiments involving direct transfer of the enzyme from low to high salt conditions produced negligible enthalpy changes that remained constant within experimental error throughout the salt concentrations studied (0-200 mM KCl).

Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes this reaction when the reductant is NADPH and gives as products L-pipecolic acid and NADP+. The reaction velocity for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is measurable in either direction. The pH-independent equilibrium constant, Keq, for the reduction of the imino acid by NADPH to give pipecolic acid anion and NADP+ was determined from the equilibrium conditions and the pKa values of pipecolic acid (10.72) and of the cyclic imino acid (8.10).

Although there is some uncertainty about the exact value, the apparent equilibrium constant for the CPK reaction (K'cpk = [creatine][ATP]/[PC][ADP]), under physiological conditions similar to those of vertebrate muscle, ranges from 100 to 160.

In both cases, the mechanism is predominantly steady state ordered with MgATP binding first in the direction of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) phosphorylation and rapid equilibrium random in the direction of MgADP phosphorylation. This is a unique kinetic mechanism for a phosphofructokinase. Product inhibition by MgADP is competitive versus MgATP and noncompetitive versus F6P while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is competitive versus fructose 6-phosphate and uncompetitive versus MgATP. The uncompetitive pattern obtained versus F6P is indicative of a dead-end E.MgATP.FBP complex. Fructose 6-phosphate is noncompetitive versus either FBP or MgADP. Dead-end inhibition by arabinose 5-phosphate or 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate is uncompetitive versus MgATP corroborating the ordered addition of MgATP prior to F6P. In the direction of MgADP phosphorylation, inhibition by anhydromannitol 1,6-bisphosphate is noncompetitive versus MgADP, while Mg-adenosine 5'(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate is noncompetitive versus FBP. Anhydromannitol 6-phosphate is a slow substrate, while anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate is not. This suggests that the enzyme exhibits beta-anomeric specificity.",87RAO/HAR,,87RAO/HAR_555

The Sp diastereomer of ATP alpha S was the preferred substrate regardless of the metal ion used, consistent with the metal ion not binding to the alpha-phosphate. With ATP beta S, the Sp diastereomer was the preferred substrate with Mg2+, and the Rp diastereomer was the preferred substrate with Cd2+. The reversal of specificity establishes that the metal is chelated through the beta-phosphate in the active site of the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction. A comparison of the Vmax values as a function of substitution of oxygen by sulfur showed the order for Mg2+ to be: ATP greater than ATP alpha S(Sp) greater than ATP alpha S(Rp) greater than ATP beta S(Sp) greater than ATP gamma S greater than ATP beta S(Rp). With Cd2+ as the activating metal ion, the order was: ATP greater than ATP alpha S(Sp) greater than ATP alpha S(Rp) greater than ATP beta S(Rp) greater than ATP gamma S greater than ATP beta S(Sp). It is concluded that the chelate structure of metal ATP substrate in the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction is the delta, beta, gamma-bidentate complex. 31P NMR measurements and radioassay with [2-14C] phosphomevalonate were used to measure the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by phosphomevalonate kinase with ATP and phosphorothioate analogues of ATP as the phosphoryl group donor. The order as a phosphate donor as determined by both methods in the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction is ATP beta S greater than ATP alpha S greater than ATP greater than ATP gamma S. Except for ATP gamma S, the equilibrium is shifted in the direction of formation of ADP alpha S and ADP beta S relative to ADP formation. Thus, ATP beta S rather than ATP would be effective for the synthesis of diphosphomevalonate.

About 10 beta-galactosyl-galactose and 10 beta-galactosyl-glucose gas-liquid chromatographic peaks were detected and it is thus very likely that every possible isomer of beta-galactosyl-galactose and beta-galactosyl-glucose was formed by the reversion reactions (taking into account both anomers for each isomer). The presence of lactose and allolactose among the beta-galactosyl-glucoses was confirmed with standards. An important finding relating to the role of allolactose as an inducer of the lac operon was that allolactose (beta-D-galactosyl-(1----6)-D-glucose) was the only disaccharide formed initially, and at equilibrium it was present in the largest amount (50%). Obviously the enzyme is specific in its ability to form allolactose, and allolactose is the most stable beta-galactosyl-glucose, both important inducer properties. The equilibrium constant (concentration of disaccharides divided by the concentration of reactants at equilibrium) of the reaction was about 9.5 mM-1. This is the first report of an equilibrium constant for the beta-galactosidase reaction. Of mechanistic significance is the fact that only three compounds were able to replace D-galactose as a reversion reactant. Two of these (L-arabinose and D-fucose) had alterations at carbon 6. The 6 position, therefore, is not essential for reactivity. The third compound was D-galactal. Any other sugars tested (even with very minor changes relative to D-galactose) did not react. Of special consequence is the 2 position. The results strongly suggest that there has to be either an equatorial hydroxyl at the 2 position of a sugar or a special reactivity (as with D-galactal) in order for the enzyme to catalyze the beta-galactosidase reaction.",86HUB/HUR,10.1016/0003-9861(86)90487-x,86HUB/HUR_930

In this paper we show that enzyme activated by S-[2,8,5'-3H]adenosylmethionine catalyzes the conversion of L-lysine to the equilibrium mixture of L-lysine and L-beta-lysine with incorporation of high levels of tritium into both isomers. The tritium levels in the isomers reflect the equilibrium constant for their interconversion, 84% in the L-beta-lysine and 16% in L-lysine compared with Keq = 5.3 +/- 0.3 in the direction of the formation of L-beta-lysine at pH 7.7 and 30 degrees C. No significant tritium is incorporated into lysine from S-[2,8-3H]adenosylmethionine or S-adenosyl[methyl-3H] methionine under comparable conditions. Therefore, the tritium incorporated into lysine in the former reaction arises from the 5'-position of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group in S-adenosylmethionine. These experiments implicate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl portion of S-adenosylmethionine in the hydrogen transfer mechanism of this reaction, perhaps in a role analogous to that played by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety of deoxyadenosyl cobalamin in coenzyme B12-dependent rearrangements.",87MOS/FRE,,87MOS/FRE_1417

Purified calcium ATPase was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles enabling control of the transmembrane calcium gradient. Calcium transport was monitored spectrophotometrically by the calcium indicator, Arsenazo III. Thus, only the enzymatic activity of coupled transport was measured. It was shown under conditions of low external calcium that ATP hydrolysis and synthesis follow simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and that Michaelis constants obtained for both processes appear independent of the calcium gradient. The maximum velocities for both hydrolysis and synthesis strongly depend on the transmembrane calcium gradient. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed in which a random addition of substrates for ATP synthesis is followed by random release of ATP and calcium. By measuring the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis under identical conditions, determination of the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis as a function of the transmembrane calcium gradient was possible. Our results indicate that the thermodynamics of the catalytic cycle can be totally accounted for by the energetics of transport of 2.2 +/- 0.3 calciums and the hydrolysis of 1 ATP.

The pH optimum for the reduction reaction for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was 8.9. The equilibrium constant for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was determined to be 3.08 x 10(-11) M; the ready reversibility of the reaction catalysed by benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase necessitated the development of an assay procedure in which hydrazine was used to trap the benzaldehyde formed by the NAD+-dependent oxidation of benzyl alcohol.

The rate is not limited by the actual polymerization but by a separate step, possibly important in ensuring fidelity [Mizrahi, V., Henrie, R. N., Marlier, J. F., Johnson, K. A., & Benkovic, S. J.

Data analysis then provides an estimate of the internal equilibrium constant. The dissociations of DNA, dNTP, and PPi from the various binary and ternary complexes were measured by partitioning (isotope-trapping) experiments. The rate constant for DNA dissociation from KF is sequence dependent and is rate limiting during nonprocessive DNA synthesis.

For the mutant enzyme, the kcat for which is some 10(3) times less than that for the wild-type enzyme, the value of kcat/Km with glyceraldehyde phosphate as substrate is almost unaffected by the presence of sucrose or glycerol, even though the concentration of the aldehyde form of the substrate is smaller because of hemiacetal formation. [The nature and relative amounts of the various forms of triose phosphate present in solution (free carbonyl forms, hydrates, dimers, hemiacetal adducts) have been evaluated by 31P NMR and are presented in the Appendix.] The viscosogenic agents cause the substrate to bind more tightly to the enzyme, roughly compensating for the lower substrate concentration. With dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate, the values of kcat/Km for the mutant enzyme increase with the addition of viscosogenic agent, consistent with the tighter binding of substrate without (in this case) any concomitant loss due to hemiketal formation. These results for the mutant enzyme (known to be limited in rate by an enolization step in the catalytic mechanism) can be used to interpret the behavior of the wild-type enzyme. Plots of the relative values of kcat/Km for catalysis by the wild-type enzyme (normalized with the corresponding data for the mutant enzyme) against the relative viscosity have slopes close to unity, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation for a cleanly diffusive process. In the presence of polymeric viscosogenic additives such as poly(ethylene glycol), polyacrylamide, or ficoll, no effect on kcat/Km is seen for the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the expectation that molecular diffusion rates are unaffected by the macroviscosity and are only slowed by the presence of smaller agents that raise the microviscosity.

Inactivation-protection studies have established the binding of adenine to AMP nucleosidase in the absence of ribose 5-phosphate. Product inhibition by adenine suggests a dead-end complex of enzyme, AMP, and adenine. Methanol does not act as a nucleophile to replace H2O in the reaction, and products do not exchange into substrate during AMP hydrolysis. Thus, the reactive complex has the properties of concerted hydrolysis by an enzyme-directed water molecule rather than by formation of a covalent intermediate with ribose 5-phosphate. The Vmax in the forward reaction (AMP hydrolysis) is 300-fold greater than that in the reverse reaction. The Keq for AMP hydrolysis has been experimentally determined to be 170 M and is in reasonable agreement with Keq values of 77 and 36 M calculated from Haldane relationships. The equilibrium for enzyme-bound substrate and products strongly favors the enzyme-product ternary complex ([enzyme-adenine ribose 5-phosphate]/[enzyme-AMP] = 480). The temperature dependence of the kinetic constants gave Arrhenius plots with a distinct break between 20 and 25 degrees C. Above 25 degrees C, AMP binding demonstrates a strong entropic effect consistent with increased order in the Michaelis complex. Below 20 degrees C, binding is tighter and the entropic component is lost, indicating distinct enzyme conformations above and below 25 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",86DEW/EMI,10.1021/bi00362a022,86DEW/EMI_946

This is a model reaction giving a condensation product with dissociating groups. The kinetics for the synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe in aqueous solution saturated with ethyl acetate was expressed by a rate equation for the rapid-equilibrium random bireactant mechanism, and the reverse hydrolysis reaction was zero-order with respect to Z-Asp-PheOMe concentration. The courses of synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system were well explained, by the rate equations obtained for the aqueous solution and by the partition of substrate and condensation product between the both phases. The rate of synthesis in the biphasic system was much lower than in aqueous solution due to the unfavorable partition of PheOMe in the aqueous phase. The equation for the equilibrium yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system was derived assuming that only the non-ionized forms of the substrate and condensation product exist in the organic phase. It was found theoretically and experimentally that the yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe is maximum at the aqueous-phase pH of around 5, lower than for synthesis in aqueous solution. The effect of the organic solvent on the rate and equilibrium for the synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe could be explained by the variation in the partition coefficient.

Following extraction from the microsomal membrane, the short-chain dehydrase undergoes, at least, a two-fold activation. Employing even-numbered trans-2-enoyl-CoA substrates ranging in carbon chain length from 4 to 16, the highest dehydrase specific activity of 16 mumol min-1 mg protein-1 was obtained with trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA; crotonyl-CoA was the second most active substrate, followed by 8 greater than 10 greater than 12 greater than 14 greater than 16.

We demonstrate the reversibility of the model reaction and measure its equilibrium constant. The pH profiles for the model reactions show that the active substrates are the N-protonated imino acid in one direction and the proline anion with a neutral amino group in the other. The V/K value for the imino acid reduction is enhanced by a group Z of pK = 8.6 in the enzyme-NADPH complex, while that for the proline reaction is unaffected by any such group in the enzyme-NADP+ complex. The following conclusions emerge from a comparison of the pH dependence of the rates for the model reactions with that for the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate [Rife, J. E., & Cleland, W. W. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 2328]. The N-protonated form of alpha-iminoglutarate and the conjugate base of glutamate are the active substrates. The redox step is not sensitive to the protonation state of the groups that catalyze the hydrolysis of bound alpha-iminoglutarate. The group Z, which facilitates the PCA reaction, plays no role in the binding of alpha-ketoglutarate.

Dissociation of 3-hexulose phosphate synthase into subunits of molecular weight approx. 49000 under conditions of low pH or low ionic strength was observed. Within the range of compounds tested, 3-hexulose phosphate synthase is specific for formaldehyde and d-ribulose 5-phosphate (forward reaction) and d-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate (reverse reaction), and phospho-3-hexuloisomerase is specific for d-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate (forward reaction) and d-fructose 6-phosphate (reverse reaction). A bivalent cation is essential for activity and stability of 3-hexulose phosphate synthase; phospho-3-hexuloisomerase is inhibited by many bivalent cations.

The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the lactate-, beta-hydroxybutyrate- and glutamate-dehydrogenase systems were measured in rat livers freeze-clamped as soon as possible after death. The substrates of these dehydrogenases are likely to be in equilibrium with free NAD(+) and NADH, and the ratio of the free dinucleotides can be calculated from the measured concentrations of the substrates and the equilibrium constants (Holzer, Schultz & Lynen, 1956; Bücher & Klingenberg, 1958). The lactate-dehydrogenase system reflects the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio in the cytoplasm, the beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial cristae and the glutamate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial matrix. 2. The equilibrium constants of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were redetermined for near-physiological conditions (38 degrees ; I0.25). 3. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio of rat-liver cytoplasm was calculated as 725 (pH7.0) in well-fed rats, 528 in starved rats and 208 in alloxan-diabetic rats. 4. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio for the mitochondrial matrix and cristae gave virtually identical values in the same metabolic state. This indicates that beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase share a common pool of dinucleotide. 5. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio within the liver mitochondria of well-fed rats was about 8. It fell to about 5 in starvation and rose to about 10 in alloxan-diabetes. 6. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios of cytoplasm and mitochondria are thus greatly different and do not necessarily move in parallel when the metabolic state of the liver changes. 7. The ratios found for the free dinucleotides differ greatly from those recorded for the total dinucleotides because much more NADH than NAD(+) is protein-bound. 8. The bearing of these findings on various problems, including the following, is discussed: the number of NAD(+)-NADH pools in liver cells; the applicability of the method to tissues other than liver; the transhydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; the physiological significance of the difference of the redox states of mitochondria and cytoplasm; aspects of the regulation of the redox state of cell compartments; the steady-state concentration of mitochondrial oxaloacetate; the relations between the redox state of cell compartments and ketosis.",67WIL/LUN,10.1042/bj1030514,67WIL/LUN_134

By replacing orthophosphate with [(32)P]orthophosphate or with arsenate, evidence was provided that the orthophosphate consumed appears in pyrophosphate. 3. Without Mg(2+) or 2-mercaptoethanol the enzyme was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated. EDTA only partially replaced the requirement for the thiol compound. The enzyme was considerably more unstable at 0 degrees or when frozen than at 22 degrees . Even with the best conditions devised the enzyme lost about 25% of its activity every 3hr. 4.

Changes in the concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alanine, aspartate, malate, lactate, pyruvate, NAD(+), NADH and adenine nucleotides were measured in freeze-clamped rat liver during ischaemia. 2. Although the concentrations of most of the metabolites changed rapidly during ischaemia the ratios [glutamate]/[2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)] and [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] changed equally and the value of the expression [3-hydroxybutyrate][2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)]/[acetoacetate][glutamate] remained approximately constant, indicating that the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase systems were at near-equilibrium with the mitochondrial NAD(+) couple. 3. The value of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] was about 0.7 in vivo and remained fairly constant during the ischaemic period of 5min, although the concentrations of alanine and oxoglutarate changed substantially. No explanation can be offered why the value of the ratio differed from that of the equilibrium constant of the alanine aminotransferase reaction, which is 1.48. 4. Injection of l-cycloserine 60min before the rats were killed increased the concentration of alanine in the liver fourfold and decreased the concentration of the other metabolites measured, except that of pyruvate. During ischaemia the concentration of alanine did not change but that of aspartate almost doubled. 5. After treatment with l-cycloserine the value in vivo of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] rose from 0.7 to 2.4. During ischaemia the value returned to 0.8. 6. The effects of l-cycloserine are consistent with the assumption that it specifically inhibits alanine aminotransferase. 7. Most of the alanine formed during ischaemia is probably derived from pyruvate and from ammonia released by the deamination of adenine nucleotides and glutamine. The alanine is presumably formed by the combined action of glutamate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase. 8. The rate of anaerobic glycolysis, calculated from the increase in the lactate concentration, was 1.3mumol/min per g fresh wt. 9. Although the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides changed rapidly during ischaemia, the ratio [ATP][AMP]/[ADP](2) remained constant at 0.54, indicating that adenylate kinase established near-equilibrium under these conditions.",70BRO/KRE,10.1042/bj1170091,70BRO/KRE_512

ADP-NO is not recognized by the translocase system located in the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, it is rapidly phosphorylated to ATP-NO in the outer compartment of mitochondria, by way of the nucleosidediphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) reaction, provided there is sufficient ATP in the mitochondria. AMP-NO is not phosphorylated by liver mitochondria to the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate; it cannot serve as substrate for adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3). ATP-NO and ADP-NO, however, are substrates of this enzyme. The apparent equilibrium constant for the reaction, ADP-NO + ADP right harpoon over left harpoon ATP-NO + AMP, of 0.908 at pH 7.4 and 5 mM Mg(2+) is significantly higher than that of the reaction with natural nucleotides. Although adenosine N(1)-oxide is easily phosphorylated to AMP-NO by adenosine kinase [Schnebli et al. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1997-2004], the formation of corresponding nucleoside triphosphate in vivo seems also to be limited by adenylate kinase; adenosine N(1)-oxide cannot replace adenosine in restoring the normal ATP level in ethionine-treated rats.",74JEB/TY,10.1073/pnas.71.11.4630,74JEB/TY_659

The K(eq.) of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase reaction was redetermined at 38 degrees C, pH7.0, I=0.25mol/l and free [Mg(2+)]=1mm, and was 4.55 in the direction of glucose 1-phosphate formation. The activity of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in rat liver was between 46 and 58mumol of glucose 1-phosphate formed/min per g fresh wt. in the four dietary conditions studied. A fluorimetric assay with enzymic cycling was developed for the measurement of glucose 1-phosphate in HClO(4) extracts of rat liver. The calculated free cytoplasmic PP(i) concentration in nmol/g fresh wt. of liver was 2.3+/-0.3 in starved, 3.8+/-0.4 in fed, 4.9+/-0.6 in meal-fed and 5.2+/-0.4 in sucrose-re-fed animals. These values agree well with recently determined direct measurements of total PP(i) in rat liver and suggest that there is not a large amount of bound or metabolically inert PP(i) in rat liver. The cytoplasmic [ATP]/[AMP][PP(i)] ratio is 10(3) times the cytoplasmic [ATP]/[ADP][P(i)] ratio and varies differently with dietary state. The reaction PP(i)+H(2)O-->2P(i) catalysed by inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) does not attain near-equilibrium in vivo. PP(i) should be considered as one of the group of small inorganic ions which is metabolically active and capable of exerting a controlling function in a number of important metabolic reactions.",74GUY/VEL,10.1042/bj1400369,74GUY/VEL_692

The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the ;malic' enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) were measured in freeze-clamped rat livers. By assuming that the reactants of these dehydrogenase systems are at equilibrium in the cytoplasm the [free NADP(+)]/[free NADPH] ratio was calculated. The justification of the assumption is discussed. 2. The values of this ratio obtained under different nutritional conditions (well-fed, 48hr.-starved, fed with a low-carbohydrate diet, fed with a high-sucrose diet) were all of the same order of magnitude although characteristic changes occurred on varying the diet. The value of the ratio fell on starvation and on feeding with the low-carbohydrate diet and rose slightly on feeding with the high-sucrose diet. 3. The mean values of the ratio were calculated to be between 0.001 and 0.015, which is about 100000 times lower than the values of the cytoplasmic [free NAD(+)]/[free NADH] ratio. 4. The differences in the redox state of the two nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide couples can be explained on a simple physicochemical basis. The differences are the result of equilibria that are determined by the equilibrium constants of a number of highly active readily reversible dehydrogenases and transaminases and the concentrations of the substrates and products of these enzymes. 5. The decisive feature is the fact that the NAD and NADP couples share substrates. This sharing provides a link between the redox states of the two couples. 6. The application of the method of calculation to data published by Kraupp, Adler-Kastner, Niessner & Plank (1967), Goldberg, Passonneau & Lowry (1966) and Kauffman, Brown, Passonneau & Lowry (1968) shows that the redox states of the NAD and NADP couples in cardiac-muscle cytoplasm and in mouse-brain cytoplasm are of the same order as those in rat liver. 7. The determination of the equilibrium constant at 38 degrees , pH7.0 and I 0.25 (required for the calculation of the [free NADP(+)]/[free NADPH] ratio), gave a value of 3.44x10(-2)m for the ;malic' enzyme (with CO(2) rather than HCO(3) (-) as the reactant) and a value of 1.98x10(-2)m(-1) for glutathione reductase.",69VEE/EGG,10.1042/bj1150609a,69VEE/EGG_501

Several positive effectors (Gln, 2-hydroxyethyl-S-cysteine, Trp and Met) stimulate the back reaction in the same manner as the forward reaction. The apparent Michaelis constant for PP(i) is 2.2 mM at pH 7.35. The pH optimum of the back reaction is 6.5-7 while the pH optimum of the forward reaction is 7.6. The apparent equilibrium constant in the presence of 10 mM Mg(2+) at pH 7.36 is 8.5 in favor of adenylylated glutamine synthetase and PP(i). The equilibrium constant is strongly dependent from pH and from Mg(2+) concentration. There is a difference of about 0.5 to 1 kcal/mole free energy between the adenylyl-O-tyrosine bond and the pyrophosphate bond of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It follows from these considerations that the adenylyl-O-tyrosine bond is an ""energy-rich phosphate bond.""",70MAN/HOL,10.1073/pnas.65.3.660 ,70MAN/HOL_708

Diaminopimelate epimerase from a soluble extract of Bacillus megaterium N.C.I.B. 7581 was purified about 25-fold by fractionation with ammonium sulphate and chromatography on calcium phosphate gel-cellulose. The product was impure but was unstable on further purification. 2. Quantitative assay methods for the enzyme were devised in which meso- or ll-diaminopimelic acid may be the substrate. 3. Between 25 degrees and 45 degrees at pH7.0 enzyme action leads to an equilibrium mixture containing 65% meso-isomer and 35% ll-isomer. 4. The initial rate of epimerization was 2-3 times as fast with ll-diaminopimelic acid as substrate as with the meso-isomer; a number of other amino acids were not racemized by the enzyme. The Michaelis constants at 37 degrees were 6.7mm (ll-isomer) and 100mm (meso-isomer); with both substrates enzyme activity was maximal at pH7-8. The relative rates of epimerization of ll-diaminopimelic acid at 25 degrees , 37 degrees and 45 degrees were 0.77:1.00:1.15. 5. A thiol compound (of which 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol was the most effective) was needed as an activator of the purified enzyme. 6. Carbonylbinding reagents and several other compounds did not inhibit diaminopimelate epimerase. 7. Pyridoxal phosphate did not stimulate enzymic activity even in preparations that had been almost completely freed of derivatives of vitamin B(6) (as shown by microbiological assay).",69WHI/LEJ,10.1042/bj1130589,69WHI/LEJ_1239

The equilibrium constant at 38 degrees and I 0.25 of the triose phosphate isomerase reaction was found to be 22.0 and that of the aldolase reaction, 0.99x10(-4)m. The [dihydroxyacetone phosphate]/[glyceraldehyde phosphate] ratio was found to be 9.3 in rat liver. The causes of the apparent deviation of the triose phosphate isomerase system from equilibrium in vivo have been investigated. 2. The equilibria of the triose phosphate isomerase and aldolase reactions were studied with relatively large concentrations of crystalline enzymes and small concentrations of substrates, approximating to those found in rat liver and muscle. There was significant binding of fructose diphosphate by aldolase under these conditions. There was no evidence that binding of glyceraldehyde phosphate by either enzyme affected the equilibria. 3. The deviation from equilibrium of the triose phosphate isomerase system in rat liver can be accounted for by the low activity of the enzyme, in relation to the flux, at low physiological concentrations of glyceraldehyde phosphate (about 3mum). It has been calculated that a flux of 1.8mumoles/min./g. wet weight of liver would be expected to cause the measured degree of disequilibrium found in vivo. 4. The conclusion that the triose phosphate isomerase is not at equilibrium is in accordance with the situation postulated by Rose, Kellermeyer, Stjernholm & Wood (1962) on the basis of isotope-distribution data. 5. The triose phosphate isomerase system is closer to equilibrium in resting muscle probably because of a very low flux and a high enzyme concentration. 6. The aldolase system deviated from equilibrium in rat liver by a factor of about 10 and by a much greater factor in resting muscle. 7. The measurement of total dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate content indicates the concentrations of the free metabolites in the tissue. This may not hold for fructose diphosphate, a significant proportion of which may be bound to aldolase.",69VEE/RAI,10.1042/bj1150837,69VEE/RAI_1286

Bacteriol. 90:1531-1536. 1965.-The properties of ureidoglycolate synthetase from Streptococcus allantoicus grown on allantoin were studied, by use of the purified enzyme preparation and crystalline sodium ureidoglycolate. Ureidoglycolate synthetase activity was maximal over the pH range of 8.4 to 8.8. No cofactors were required for the reaction. Enzyme activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate at relatively high concentrations, by Hg(++) or Zn(++) ions, and to a lesser extent by several other metal cations. The maximal velocity for the purified ureidoglycolate synthetase, determined graphically from a Lineweaver-Burk plot, was 220 mumoles of glyoxylate formed per min per mg of protein. The substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity was 3.3 x 10(-2)m. The equilibrium constant for the synthesis of ureidoglycolate was determined in a series of reaction mixtures covering a wide range of initial concentrations of reactants. The position of the equilibrium was not affected by a change in pH or by the presence of enzyme. The equilibrium constant for the reaction in the direction of synthesis was 7.6, corresponding to a negative free energy change of 1,230 cal per mole.",65GAU/WOL,,65GAU/WOL_1226

The purified enzyme preparation was homogeneous on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was free from contaminating enzymes including NADH oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase. The enzyme catalyzed the cleavage of N-acetylneuraminic acid to N-acetylmannosamine and pyruvate in a reversible reaction. Both cleavage and synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid had the same pH optimum around 7.7. The enzyme was stable between pH 6.0 to 9.0, and was thermostable up to 60 degrees C. The thermal stability increased up to 75 degrees C in the presence of pyruvate. No metal ion was required for the enzyme activity, but heavy metal ions such as Ag+ and Hg2+ were potent inhibitors. Oxidizing agents such as N-bromosuccinimide, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide, and SH-inhibitors such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and mercuric chloride were also potent inhibitors. The Km values for N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid were 3.6 mM and 4.3 mM, respectively. Pyruvate inhibited the cleavage reaction competitively; Ki was calculated to be 1.0 mM. In the condensation reaction, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, glucosamine, and galactosamine could not replace N-acetylmannosamine as substrate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate, beta-hydroxypyruvate, and other pyruvate derivatives could not replace pyruvate as substrate.

The reaction can be followed spectrophotometrically or by analysis of the reaction mixture by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The products have also been isolated and characterized. Oxygen uptake during the reaction is much less than stoichiometric with H2folate disappearance and is attributed to autoxidation of the H4folate formed. The dismutation activity is a property of highly purified Streptococcus faecium DHFR isoenzyme 2 (but not isoenzyme 1) and of Lactobacillus casei DHFR, but not of bovine liver DHFR. The activity is dependent on tightly bound NADP+ and/or NADPH. Removal of the nucleotide results in loss of dismutation activity, which is restored by adding NADP+ or NADPH. Maximum activity is obtained when approximately 1 mol equiv of nucleotide is added per mol of DHFR. It is proposed that in the dismutation reaction bound NADP(H) is alternately reduced and oxidized by incoming molecules of H2folate with release of folate and H4folate, respectively. The relatively slow rate of folate formation presumably limits the rate of the overall reaction. The equilibrium constant for the dismutation reaction is 19.4 +/- 7.4 at 22 degrees C and pH 7.0. Calculation of standard oxidation-reduction potentials at pH 7 gave values of -0.230 V for the H2folate/H4 folate pair and -0.268 V for the folate/H2folate pair. The mechanism by which NADP+ is retained by the enzyme from some sources during purification procedures is unclear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",84BLA/COC,10.1021/bi00306a009,84BLA/COC_295

When pyruvate is varied at pH 9.35, levels of ammonia above 50 mM cause uncompetitive substrate inhibition and cause the slope replot to go through the origin. This pattern suggest that iminopyruvate (2% of pyruvate at this pH with 150 mM ammonia) can combine with E-NADH much more tightly than pyruvate does but reacts much more slowly because uptake of the required proton from solution is hindered. Isomerization of the initially formed E-NAD complex to a form which can productively bind L-alanine is the slowest step in the forward direction at pH 7.9, and substrate inhibition by L-alanine largely results from combination of the zwitterion in a nonproductive fashion with this initial E-NAD complex, with the result that the isomerization is prevented. All bimolecular rate constants approach diffusion-limited values at optimal states of protonation of enzyme and substrates except that for ammonia, suggesting that ammonia does not form a complex with E-NADH-pyruvate but reacts directly with it to give a bound carbinolamine.",81GRI/CLE,10.1021/bi00523a002,81GRI/CLE_272

This enzymatic reaction, which has been considered virtually irreversible, was found to be reversible under such conditions that glutathione liberated from the thiolester was trapped. The reverse reaction could be monitored spectrophotometrically by use of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate). In addition to 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), 2,2'-dithiobispyridine and cystamine were used to promote the reverse reaction.

Mice were fed cCr or beta GPA and their muscles assayed for substrates and products of the CK reaction by 31P NMR spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. After three weeks of feeding, gamma was indistinguishable from Kcomb in cCr-treated muscles demonstrating both PCr/Cr and phospho-analog/analog must have equilibrated with a constant and uniform cellular ATP/ADP ratio. In beta GPA-treated muscles, gamma was smaller than Kcomb due to a higher content of muscle beta GPA. Feeding beta GPA for 9-12 weeks resulted in a closer agreement between Kcomb and gamma, suggesting ATP/ADP ratios are not uniform within the muscle perhaps due to transient metabolic stress in some cells. From this analysis it follows that calculation of free ADP from the CK equilibrium for a heterogeneous population of cells with respect to total Cr and ATP content is correct only if chemical potentials of these cells are uniform.",95WIS/KUS,,95WIS/KUS_612

We have studied its equilibrium and transient kinetics in the direction of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-bis-P-glycerate) production: ATP + 3-P-glycerate<==>ADP + 1,3-bis-P-glycerate. We devised a sensitive method for following this production. PGK is mixed with 3-P-glycerate and [gamma-32P]ATP in a rapid flow quench apparatus. The reaction mixtures are aged for 4 ms or more and then quenched in acid in which any [1-32P]-1,3-P-glycerate decomposes to 3-P-glycerate and 32Pi, which is determined specifically. The Pi reflects accurately the 1,3-bis-P-glycerate in the original reaction mixture, and the kcat obtained is identical to that obtained by the conventional linked assay method with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This does not support the postulate of a rapid direct transfer of the 1,3-bis-P-glycerate between the kinase and the dehydrogenase [Srivastava, D. K., & Bernhard, S. A.

A complete initial velocity study in both reaction directions suggests that the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl CoA and L-serine to O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and coenzyme A (CoASH) by a ping pong bi bi kinetic mechanism. Initial velocity patterns in the absence of added inhibitors in both directions are best described by a series of parallel lines. Product inhibition by OAS is competitive with respect to acetyl CoA and noncompetitive with respect to L-serine, while product inhibition by L-serine is competitive against CoASH and noncompetitive against OAS. Glycine and S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMC) were used as dead-end analogs of L-serine and OAS, respectively. Glycine is competitive against L-serine, and uncompetitive against acetyl CoA, while SMC is competitive against OAS and uncompetitive against CoASH. All of the above inhibition patterns are consistent with those predicted for a single site ping pong bi bi kinetic mechanism. The equilibrium constant for the transacetylase reaction is 15 in the direction of serine acetylation. The constant was measured by monitoring the change in CoASH concentration obtained for reactions in which the ratio of acetyl CoA/CoASH was constant and the ratio of OAS/serine was varied.

The aim of the present work was to determine whether glutamate chain length (one to six glutamate residues) influenced the affinity constant for tetrahydrofolate and the maximal velocities displayed by these two enzymes. The results show that the affinity constant decreased by at least one order of magnitude when the tetrahydrofolate substrate contained three or more glutamate residues.

These results are consistent with analyses of mitochondrial folates which revealed a pool of polyglutamates dominated by tetra and pentaglutamates.

In this study, we measure the Vmax of flight muscle PGI, the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme, the apparent equilibrium constants for the reaction and the tissue concentrations of substrate and product.

The distribution of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic marker enzymes indicates that the presence of mitochondrial arginine kinase is not due to cytoplasmic contamination. Arginine is not oxidized by the midgut mitochondria but, when metabolic substrates and ATP are present, respiration can be initiated by the addition of arginine. Under these conditions, there is no return to State 4 respiration, indicating regeneration of ADP by the arginine kinase reaction. Respiration can be blocked, however, by atractyloside, an inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator. These results indicate that arginine kinase resides outside the matrix. Mitochondrial arginine kinase is specific to l-arginine since analogs of l-arginine are ineffective in stimulating respiration in the presence of ATP. Coupling between the adenine nucleotide translocator and arginine kinase was investigated using kinetic and thermodynamic approaches. There were no differences in the activities of arginine kinase in respiring and non-respiring mitochondria when they were measured at different ATP or arginine concentrations. This result indicates that arginine kinase does not have preferential access to the ATP exported out of the matix.

Anal Biochem. 1998. 256(1):7-13,1998,Thompson JE; Jordan DB,Anal Biochem,256,1,7-13,https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9466792,"We describe a multiwavelength method for measuring an enzyme's discrimination of one substrate over another by continuously monitoring the reactions of the two substrates simultaneously. This method is generally applicable to ultraviolet-visible diode array or rapid-scanning spectrophotometers and the measurement requires a single incubation of enzyme with two substrates. Rates at each of the wavelengths may be fit globally by using a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure which provides adequate statistical analysis. The specificity of trypsin for N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BRpNA) over N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-alanine-p-nitrophenylester (BocApNP) was 2.1 as measured by the multiwavelength partition method and 2.3 by comparing the individual kcat/K(m)'s for the two substrates. Multiwavelength analysis was applied to two enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for fungal melanin: scytalone dehydratase and trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from Magnaporthea grisea. The specificity of trihydroxynaphthalene reductase for 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-4H-benzopyran-4-one compared to scytalone, a natural substrate for the enzyme, was 95. Scytalone dehydratase was eight-fold more specific for 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-4H-benzopyran-4-one than it was for scytalone. Multiwavelength analysis was also used to measure an equilibrium constant of 0.040 for the reaction ¿dihydroorotate + oxonic acid<-->orotate + dihydrooxonic acid¿ catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Advantages, limitations, and further applications of this steady-state method, which directly measures relative substrate specificities, are delineated. All studies described in this paper were at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C.",98THO/JOR,10.1006/abio.1997.2490,98THO/JOR_267

Choline kinase catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the CDP-choline pathway. The yeast enzyme was overexpressed 106-fold in Sf-9 insect cells and purified 71.2-fold to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography with concanavalin A, Affi-Gel Blue, and Mono Q. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified choline kinase matched perfectly with the deduced sequence of the CKI gene. The minimum subunit molecular mass (73 kDa) of purified choline kinase was in good agreement with the predicted size (66.3 kDa) of the CKI gene product. Native choline kinase existed in oligomeric structures of dimers, tetramers, and octomers. The amounts of the tetrameric and octomeric forms increased in the presence of the substrate ATP. Antibodies were raised against the purified enzyme and were used to identify choline kinase in insect cells and in S. cerevisiae. Maximum choline kinase activity was dependent on Mg2+ ions (10 mM) at pH 9.5 and at 30 degrees C. The equilibrium constant (0.2) for the reaction indicated that the reverse reaction was favored in vitro. The activation energy for the reaction was 6.26 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was labile above 30 degrees C. Choline kinase exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to choline and positive cooperative kinetics with respect to ATP (n = 1.4-2.3). Results of the kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme catalyzes a sequential Bi Bi reaction. The Vmax for the reaction was 138.7 micromol/min/mg, and the Km values for choline and ATP were 0.27 mM and 90 microM, respectively. The turnover number per choline kinase subunit was 153 s-1. Ethanolamine was a poor substrate for the purified choline kinase, and it was also poor inhibitor of choline kinase activity. ADP inhibited choline kinase activity (IC50 = 0.32 mM) in a positive cooperative manner (n = 1.5), and the mechanism of inhibition with respect to ATP and choline was complex. The regulation of choline kinase activity by ATP and ADP may be physiologically relevant.",98KIM/VOE,,98KIM/VOE_559

The calorimetric measurements led to standard molar enthalpy changes for all four of these reactions. Direct measurements yielded an apparent equilibrium constant for the third reaction; equilibrium constants for the remaining three reactions were obtained by using thermochemical cycle calculations. The results of the calorimetric and equilibrium measurements were analyzed in terms of a chemical equilibrium model that accounted for the multiplicity of the ionic states of the reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities for chemical reference reactions involving specific ionic forms have been obtained. These quantities permit the calculation of the position of equilibrium of the above four reactions as a function of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Values of the apparent equilibrium constants and standard transformed Gibbs free energy changes delta r G'(m) degree under approximately physiological conditions are given. Le Châtelier's principle provides an explanation as to why, in the metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of L-tryptophan, the third reaction proceeds in the direction of formation of indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate even though the apparent equilibrium constant greatly favors the formation of 1-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate.",98KIS/TEW,10.1016/s0301-4622(98)00151-3,98KIS/TEW_1188

The central pathway of benzoyl-CoA metabolism is initiated by an ATP-driven reduction of the aromatic ring producing cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The 1,5-dienoyl-CoA intermediate is thought to be transformed to 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA by a specific dienoyl-CoA hydratase catalyzing the formal addition of water to one of the double bonds. This dienoyl-CoA hydratase was detected in the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica after anaerobic growth with benzoate. Substrate and product were confirmed and a convenient spectrophotometric assay was developed. The equilibrium concentrations of substrate and product were almost equal. Enzyme activity was induced after anoxic growth with benzoate, in contrast to acetate. The enzyme of 28 kDa was purified from T. aromatica and was found to be highly specific for the cyclic 1,5-dienoyl-CoA. A second 29-kDa enoyl-CoA hydratase acted on crotonyl-CoA; this highly active enoyl-CoA hydratase also acted slowly on cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The regulation of expression of dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity, the kinetic constants, the substrate specificity, and the specific activity of the enzyme in cell extract provide evidence that dienoyl-CoA hydratase is the second enzyme of the central benzoyl-CoA pathway of anaerobic aromatic metabolism in T. aromatica. Extracts of Rhodopseudomonas palustris contained high activity of cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase, but no 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity. It appears that a variant of the benzoyl-CoA pathway is operating in R. palustris in which hydration of the 1,5-dienoyl-CoA does not take place. Rather, cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA is hydrated to 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA [corrected].",98LAE/EIS,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2550618.x,98LAE/EIS_1204

The classical ribonuclease mechanism involves a reversible transphosphorylation step, followed by quasi irreversible hydrolysis of the cyclic intermediate. We performed isotope-exchange and intermediate-trapping experiments showing that the second hydrolysis step is readily reversible in the presence of RNase A or RNase T1. As a consequence, the equilibrium between a phosphodiester and a 2',3'-cyclophosphate accounts for all catalysed reactions, even if the leaving/attacking group is a water molecule. Therefore, ribonucleases are transferases rather than hydrolases. The equilibrium constant for the catalysed interconversion is close to 1 M. From this result, we estimate the effective concentration of the 2'-hydroxyl nucleophile in the cyclization step to be 10(7) M. The high effective concentration of the vicinal hydroxyl group balances the strain-associated and solvation-associated instability of the pentacyclic phosphodiester.",98LOV/LAU,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2570286.x,98LOV/LAU_857

The interconversion of hydroxypyruvate and l-glycerate in the presence of NAD and rat-liver l-lactate dehydrogenase has been demonstrated. Michaelis constants for these substrates together with an equilibrium constant have been determined and compared with those for pyruvate and l-lactate. 2. The presence of d-glycerate dehydrogenase in rat liver has been confirmed and the enzyme has been purified 16-20-fold from the supernatant fraction of a homogenate, when it is free of l-lactate dehydrogenase, with a 23-29% recovery. The enzyme catalyses the interconversion of hydroxypyruvate and d-glycerate in the presence of either NAD or NADP with almost equal efficiency. d-Glycerate dehydrogenase also catalyses the reduction of glyoxylate, but is distinct from l-lactate dehydrogenase in that it fails to act on pyruvate, d-lactate or l-lactate. The enzyme is strongly dependent on free thiol groups, as shown by inhibition with p-chloromercuribenzoate, and in the presence of sodium chloride the reduction of hydroxypyruvate is activated. Michaelis constants for these substrates of d-glycerate dehydrogenase and an equilibrium constant for the NAD-catalysed reaction have been calculated. 3. An explanation for the lowered V(max.) with d-glycerate as compared with dl-glycerate for the rabbit-kidney d-alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase has been proposed.",65DAW/DIC,10.1042/bj0940353,65DAW/DIC_114

A method of preparation and purification of citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) from Aerobacter aerogenes is described. 2. The equilibrium of this reaction has been determined at pH 8.4 and 25 degrees . It has been shown that K, i.e. [citrate(3-)]/[oxaloacetate(keto) (2-)][acetate (-)], is 3.08+/-0.72, but that K(app.), i.e. [total citrate]/[total oxaloacetate][total acetate], is markedly affected by the initial concentrations of the reactants and magnesium. 3. The free-energy change during the cleavage of citrate has been calculated and compared with data from other sources. 4. The free energy of hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA has been evaluated from the present data. 5. A detailed knowledge of the interactions of the reactants with metal ions has been shown to be important in the calculation of the equilibrium constant and related thermodynamic functions.",65TAT/DAT,10.1042/bj0940470,65TAT/DAT_1126

The stability of the enzyme was dependent on the protein concentration and the addition of dicarboxylic acids. The purified enzyme (89 kDa) consisted of two subunits (57 and 24 kDa). No cofactor was required for full activity of this colorless enzyme. Maximum enzyme activity was measured at pH 8 and 45 degrees C. The K(m) for maleate was 0.35 mM, and that for citraconate was 0.20 mM. Thiol reagents, such as p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate completely inhibited malease activity. Malease activity was competitively inhibited by d-malate (K(i) = 0.63 mM) and d-citramalate (K(i) = 0.083 mM) and by the substrate analog 2,2-dimethylsuccinate (K(i) = 0.025 mM).

The enzyme from both sources operates over a broad pH range from 6.0 to 9.5. Below pH 6.0, activity decreases sharply, with no detectable activity at pH 5.0. Of the nucleotides tested (ATP and the triphosphates of deoxyadenosine, uridine, inosine, and guanosine), only ATP was acted upon by the enzyme from either source. The enzyme requires Mg(++) for activity. Incubation of the enzyme from both organisms with ATP and S(35)O(4) (=) in the presence of helium resulted in the formation of an S(35)-labeled nucleotide whose electrophoretic mobility was identical to that of chemically prepared APS. When incubated with ATP and the group VI anions (CrO(4), MoO(4), WO(4)), the enzyme from both organisms formed an unstable intermediate, resulting in the accumulation of pyrophosphate. Thermal stability studies revealed that the ATP-sulfurylase of C. nigrificans was stable at higher temperatures than the enzyme obtained from D. desulfuricans. Exposure of the enzyme from C. nigrificans to 65 C for 2 hr gave virtually no decrease in activity. In contrast, the enzyme from D. desulfuricans was completely inactivated after 30 min at 55 C, after 3 min at 60 C, or after 1 min at 65 C.",62AKA/CAM,,62AKA/CAM_680

The enzyme is absolutely specific for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as a cofactor, and oxidizes only glucose or its analogue 2-deoxyglucose via the following reversible reaction: beta-d-glucose + NADP right harpoon over left harpoon d-glucono-delta-lactone + NADPH(2) + H(+). K(m) values were 2.3 x 10(-2) for glucose and 2 x 10(-4) for NADP. Monovalent cations were required for stability of the enzyme and stimulated activity. The pH optimum was 7.0, and the equilibrium constant was determined to be 13.4 x 10(-7) at pH 6.4. Among the Lactobacillaceae, glucose dehydrogenase activity was found to be essentially limited to members of the genus Pediococcus. Studies on the enzymatic composition of P. pentosaceus viewed in conjunction with other available data led to the conclusion that this enzyme is not involved to any significant extent in the energy metabolism of this organism.",65LEE/DOB,,65LEE/DOB_211

The activity of the enzyme, which catalyzes an NADP-dependent oxidation of the substrate to glucose-6-phosphate, was detected in leaves of Prunus mume, Prunus persica, Rhaphiolepsis indica, Sorbus aucuparia, Cydonia oblonga, Photinia glabra, Sorbaria kirilowii, and Spiraea thunbergii.The enzyme was purified about 60-fold from leaves of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) using affinity chromatography with Blue Sepharose. Neither mannitol-1-phosphate nor fructose-6-phosphate served as substrate. Molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 65,000 at pH 8.0 by gel filtration. Since sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a peptide of 33,000 daltons, the enzyme was assumed to be a dimer at pH 8.0 K(m) values for sorbitol-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, NADP, and NADPH were 2.22 millimolar, 11.6 millimolar, 13.5 micromolar, and 1.61 micromolar, respectively. Equilibrium constant for sorbitol-6-phosphate oxidation was 5.12 x 10(-10). Optimal pH for sorbitol-6-phosphate oxidation was 9.8. The enzyme showed its maximum activity within a broad pH range between 7 and 9 for glucose-6-phosphate reduction. The enzyme was more effective in the direction of glucose-6-phosphate reduction than in the reverse direction at neutral pH. Thus, it is suggested that the enzyme catalyzes sorbitol synthesis from glucose-6-phosphate during photosynthesis in leaves of Rosaceous plants.",81HIR,10.1104/pp.67.2.221,81HIR_225

The enzyme has two subunits, one of 59,000 daltons, and one of 62,000 daltons. In native gels stained for activity, the enzyme appears to exist in the dimeric, tetrameric, and predominantly the octameric forms.The enzyme uses either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) as the required divalent cation, and utilizes NADP at a rate less than 20% of that with NAD. With Mn(2+) the K(m) for malate(2-) is lower than with Mg(2+), but V(max) is lower than with Mg(2+). In the forward (malate-decarboxylating) direction with NAD, the kinetic parameters are essentially like those observed for the enzyme from C(3) plants. In the reverse reaction, run with Mn(2+), the activity is 1.5% of that in the forward reaction. The equilibrium constant is 1.1 x 10(-3) molar.The kinetic mechanism of the reaction, at least in the forward direction, is sequential, with apparently random binding of all reaction components. Product inhibition patterns confirm this.The enzyme displays a strong hysteretic lag, which is shortened by high enzyme concentrations, high substrate concentrations, and the presence of the product NADH.The enzyme is activated by coenzyme A with K(a) = 4 micromolar. AMP also shows competitive activation, with K(a) = 24 micromolar. The activation by coenzyme A and AMP is additive, implying separate sites for their binding. Phosphoenolpyruvate activates the reaction at low (micromolar) concentrations, but higher concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate cause deactivation. Fumarate(2-) is a strong activator, with K(a) = 0.3 millimolar. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activates the enzyme, but its most pronounced effect is in shortening the lag. Citrate is a competitive inhibitor of malate, with K(i) = 4.9 millimolar.",83WED/BLA,10.1104/pp.72.4.1021,83WED/BLA_146

The forward and reverse reactions catalysed by ATP-creatine phosphotransferase have been studied kinetically at pH8.0 in the presence and absence of products, under conditions in which the free Mg(2+) concentration was maintained constant at 1mm. Thus at fixed pH the reaction may be considered as being bireactant and expressed as:MgATP(2-)+creatine(0)right harpoon over left harpoonMgADP(-)+phosphocreatine(2-)2. The initial-velocity pattern in the absence of products and the product-inhibition pattern have been determined. These are consistent with a random mechanism in which all steps are in rapid equilibrium except that concerned with the interconversion of the central ternary complexes, and in which two dead-end complexes (enzyme-MgADP-creatine and enzyme-MgATP-phosphocreatine) are formed. The results are in accord with previous suggestions that the enzyme possesses distinct sites for the combination of the nucleotide and guanidino substrates. 3. Values have been determined for the Michaelis and dissociation constants involved in the combination of each substrate with various enzyme forms. Although these values cannot be regarded as absolute, they appear to indicate that the presence of one substrate on the enzyme enhances the combination of the second substrate. In addition, it would seem that in the formation of the enzyme-MgADP-creatine complex the concentration of one reactant does not affect the combination of the other. This contrasts with the formation of the enzyme-MgATP-phosphocreatine complex, where each reactant hinders the combination of the other.",65MOR/JAM,10.1042/bj0970037,65MOR/JAM_594

The relationship between the two reactions can thus be determined. Much attention has been given to the reaction with xylose as substrate. The optimal conditions of the xylose reaction in terms of pH, buffer, metal ions, substrate concentration, temperature, and ionic strength have been determined. These findings did not differ much from those reported for the glucose reaction. Equilibrium constants for the aldose to ketose conversion were more favorable in the case of glucose. The results obtained with continuous isomerization of xylose in columns packed with either Sweetzyme Q or Taka-Sweet were very similar to those obtained from batch isomerization processes. Particle size had a definite effect on reaction rate, which indicates that diffusion limitations do occur with the immobilized enzyme particles. Heat stability of Sweetzyme Q was good with t(1/2) of 118, 248, and 1200 h at 70, 55, and 40 degrees C, respectively. A novel method for the separation of xylose-xylulose mixtures with water as eluant on a specially prepared Dowex 1 x 8 column was developed. This technique has the capability of producing pure xylulose for industrial or research applications. A writ for a patent regarding this technique is at present prepared.",86OLI/TOI,10.1002/bit.260280508,86OLI/TOI_1330

Solvent effects on lipase-catalyzed esterification of glycerol and fatty acids.. Biotechnol Bioeng. 1993. 42(8):953-62,1993,Janssen AE; Van der Padt A; Riet KV,Biotechnol Bioeng,42,8,953-62,https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18613144,"The lipase-catalyzed acylglycerol synthesis with fatty acids of different chain length is studied. Measured ester mole fractions at equilibrium are compared with calculated mole fractions. For these calculations the computer program TREP (Two-phase Reaction Equilibrium Prediction) is used. This program is based on the UNIFAC group contribution method and is developed for nondilute two-phase reaction systems.With one set of equilibrium constants, namely 1.3, 0.8, and 0.6 for monoester, diester, and triester synthesis, respectively, the equilibrium position of the reaction between glycerol and all saturated fatty acids with a chain length from 6 to 18 and oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) can be calculated. Deviations, expressed as the ratio between calculated and measured ester mole fractions, usually were between 0.7 and 1.2. In the presence of solvents, the deviations of the monoester mole fractions were higher and rose up to 3. Without addition of a solvent, the ester mole fractions at equilibrium are dependent on the fatty acid chain length. With the short-chain hexanoic acid, the monoester mole fraction is the highest ester mole fraction, while for the long-chain oleic acid, the diester mole fraction is the highest one. The ester mole fractions become independent on the chain length of the fatty acid with a solvent added in a sufficient high concentration. Both reactions, with saturated and unsaturated C(18) fatty acids, lead to the same equilibrium position. The program TREP is found to make good predictions of the equilibrium amounts of ester and fatty acid. However, systematic deviations arise between measured and calculated amounts of water and glycerol in the organic phase. The calculated water and glycerol amounts are always lower than the measured ones. These deviations seem to be highest in nonpolar media and are probably due to deficiencies in the UNIFAC calculation method. Some preliminary experiments show the effect of the choice of solvent on the reaction rates. In polar solvents, the monoester production rate is enhances by a factor of 1.5 as compared to the reaction rate in a system without solvent.",93JAN/PAD,10.1002/bit.260420806,93JAN/PAD_742
