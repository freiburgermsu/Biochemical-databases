# Establishing TECRDB provenance

### Name = Description
-> 2021-08-18_master_with_DOIs.csv = The master TECR file with DOIs and PMIDs mapped to ~1/4 of datums and ~1/2 of references in the TECRDB. \ 
-> 2021-08-18_DOI_incorporation_1.ipynb = The Notebook of codes that programmatically mined the reference identifiers and added the content to the master file. This code can be generalized to ingraining provenance to the entire master_file, once a larger preliminary mapping is established.
