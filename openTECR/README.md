# NIST Thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
The TECR database was processed through the Notebooks and files of this folder. The assembled and organized data was then contributed to [ModelSEED](https://modelseed.org/biochem/reactions), which is a prominent and well-curated thermodynamic database. 

## ModelSEED_contribution_directions
A general guideline for contributing thermodynamic data to ModelSEED is provided by the text document in this folder.

## ModelSEED_data
This folder contains thermodynamic data from ModelSEED. The _2021-06-27_TECR_compounds_in_ModelSEED_ JSON file contains the names and identifiers for all compounds from TECR reactions that are matched in ModelSEED. The _2021-06-20_undescribed_ModelSEED_cpds_ CSV, by contrast, lists all of the TECR compounds that were not identified in ModelSEED.

## TECR_files
This folder contains the Notebook and the corresponding files that were used to scrap, organize, and assemble the TECR database. The CSV files contain raw TECR data, while the JSON files contain processed TECR data. The HTML file and corresponding folder were used by the Notebook code to complete the scraping.
