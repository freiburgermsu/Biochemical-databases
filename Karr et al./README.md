# Karr et al.
The work of Karr et al., 2012 is reformatted through these files and Notebook codes. The WholeCellKB.org was webscraped and was separately downloaded through website functionality to yield the JSON files of the "json_data" folder. The two methods were separately processed and are separately discussed in the following sections, although, the reactions data between the two methods were identical. The supplementary excel file from [Karr et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044) generated each of the JSON files in this folder, yet, the reactions data was identical to the data from the WholeCellKB.org website.

## Scraping
The website was scraped through the "2021-03-21_APF_WCKB web scraping_12.ipynb" Notebook.

## Processing
The downloaded files in the "json_data" folder were processed through the "2021-03-23_APF_combining the Karr et al. datasets_04.ipynb" Notebook. 

## Supplemental excel file
The "tableS3.xlsx" file from the supplemental materials of Karr et al. was processed through the "2021-02-08_APF_Karr excel file data mining_02.ipynb" Notebook.

## Final file
The WholeCellKB.org datasets were compared in the "2021-03-23_APF_combining the Karr et al. datasets_04.ipynb" Notebook. The complete biochemical data of Karr et al., 2012 is presented in the "2021-03-24_APF_WCKB reactions + references.json" file of the main repository page.
