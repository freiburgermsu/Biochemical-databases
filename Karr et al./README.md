# Karr et al.
The work of Karr et al., 2012 is reformatted through these files and code Notebooks. The data from the WholeCellKB.org was acquired from both webscraping and from downloading functionality of the website. The data from the two methods were separately processed and discussed in the following sections, although, the reactions data between the two methods was determined to be identical. The supplementary excel file from Karr et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044) was an additional source of biochemical data and specifically the references of the biochemical data.

## Scraping
The website was scraped through the "2021-03-21_APF_WCKB web scraping_12.ipynb" Notebook.

## Processing
The downloaded JSON files in the "json_data" folder were processed through the "2021-03-23_APF_combining the Karr et al. datasets_04.ipynb" Notebook. 

## Supplemental excel file
The excel file "tableS3.xlsx" from the supplemental materials of  was processed through the "2021-02-08_APF_Karr excel file data mining_02.ipynb" Notebook.

## Final file
The WholeCellKB.org datasets were compared in the "2021-03-23_APF_combining the Karr et al. datasets_04.ipynb" Notebook. 

The complete biochemical data of Karr et al., 2012 is presented in the "2021-03-24_APF_WCKB reactions + references.json" file of the main repository page.
