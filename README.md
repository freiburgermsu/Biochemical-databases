# Biochemical-databases
Accurate biochemical models require an abundance of biochemical data. We have amassed biochemical data through the Python Notebook codes and files of this repository. The intention of the data is to refine the parameters of kinetic models of bacterial biochemistry.

## TECR
This folder contains the files and codes that processed the _NIST Thermodynamics of Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions_ database. 

## Karr et al.
The Karr_et_al folder contains the files and codes that processed the work of [Karr et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044). The data was primarily acquired by the exporting JSON files from the WholeCellKB.org website, with complementary data from scraping the [WholeCellKB.org website](wholecellkb.org) and with the supplementary excel file from the 2012 publication.
