# Biochemical-databases
Accurate biochemical models require an abundance of biochemical data. We have amassed biochemical data from various databases with the intention of applying the data in flux balance analysis (FBA) model parameters. The Python Notebook codes and intermediary and output files are organized into respective folders for each amalgamated database.

## NIST
The NIST folder contains the files for acquiring and processing biochemical data from the NIST Thermodynamics of Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions database. The final data is provided in the "2021-03-21_APF_NIST consolidated_01.json" and the "2021-03-21_vetted + reorganized NIST_1.csv" files.

## Karr et al.
The Karr et al. folder contains the files for acquiring and processing biochemical data from the work of Karr et al.. The body of work is primarily represented by the exported JSON files for the WholeCellKB.org website, which was complemented by webscraping the WholeCellKB.org website and with the supplementary excel file from the [2012 publication of Karr et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044) publication. The final data is provided in the "2021-03-25_APF_WCKB reactions + references.json" file.
