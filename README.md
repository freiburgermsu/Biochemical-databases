# Biochemical-databases
Accurate biochemical models require an abundance of biochemical data. We have amassed biochemical data from various biochemical database with the intention of applying the data to parameterize an extensive biochemical model. The Python Notebook codes, intermediary files, and output JSON files for each of the biochemical databases are organized in respective folders.

## NIST
The NIST folder contains the files for acquiring and processing the biochemical data from the NIST Thermodynamics of Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions database. The final data is provided as a JSON file.

## Karr et al.
The Karr et al. folder contains the files of acquired and processed biochemical data from the work of Karr et al.. The body of work includes the export JSON files of the WholeCellKB.org website, which was essentially identical with the scraped data of the WholeCellKB.org website, and the supplementary excel file from the thesis of Karr @ Stanford. The final data is provided as a JSON file.
